# Name Census Analyzer

# Overview
Developed by Ash Apsangi on 11/27/2023, the nameCensus Java program is designed to analyze name data from the US census of 2005. It identifies common names across genders and provides counts of boys and girls for each name based on input files containing popular boy and girl names.

# Features

# Prerequisites

- Command line interface or Java IDE for executing the program.
- The girlnames.txt and boynames.txt files in the same directory as the program.
  
# How to Run
- Place the girlnames.txt and boynames.txt files in the same directory as the nameCensus.java file.
- Open your command line or IDE.
- Navigate to the directory containing the Java file.
- Compile the program with javac nameCensus.java.
